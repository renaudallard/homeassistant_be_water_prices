"""The archive branch's texts as a render cache.

A card's bytes hash to a digest, and every row on the archive branch names,
per reader variant, the text that digest rendered to. Installed as the
readers' render hook (``providers/_pdf.render_through``), a downloaded card
whose bytes are already known is served that text instead of being rendered
again. The download still happens, so whoever installs the cache keeps
measuring timing, bytes, status codes and freshness; only the render, which
is the cost, is skipped when nothing changed.

Shared by the card archiver, which also keeps bytes it has not seen, and the
live check, which reads the branch and renders only what is new. Imports
nothing from the integration so either script can use it as is.
