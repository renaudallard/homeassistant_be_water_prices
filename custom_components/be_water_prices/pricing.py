"""Pure cost-projection helpers (no Home Assistant imports).

Kept separate from :mod:`coordinator` so the math is unit-testable from
a plain venv. The coordinator imports both helpers and applies them to
the user's stored options:

  * :func:`compute_annual_cost` -- the full-year projection that powers
    ``sensor.water_projected_annual_cost``. Pro-rates nothing.
  * :func:`compute_ytd_cost` -- the running year-to-date bill that
    powers ``sensor.water_current_year_cost``. The volumetric branch is
    the same; only the annual fees (vastrecht / redevance) are
    pro-rated by the elapsed fraction of the calendar year so the
    sensor sits at ~0 on Jan 1 and grows to the full fee by Dec 31.

    ``fee_factor`` (1.0 for the full-year projection, 0..1 for YTD).

    Returns ``None`` when the tariff is shaped for a region whose math
    is not yet wired in.

    **Brussels** (linear): ``consumption × (linear + sanering) +
    fee_factor · redevance``, then VAT. ``persons`` unused.

    **Wallonia** (tier): the first 30 m³ pay ``0.5·CVD + 0·CVA + FSE``
    per m³ (CVA is exempt on the residential first block by CWaPE
    rule), above 30 m³ pays the full ``CVD + CVA + FSE``, plus
    ``fee_factor · redevance``. ``persons`` unused. The block allowance
    is annual (resets on Jan 1), so YTD consumption fills it up the
    same way an annual projection does.

    **Flanders** (block): basis volume = ``30 + 30·persons`` m³ (capped
    at persons=5 by the config flow). Inside the basis volume each m³
    pays ``basis + sanering_boven + sanering_gemeente``; above it each
    m³ pays the comforttarief which is exactly ``2 ×`` each of those
    components -- this 2× rule is mandated by VMM and applies
    uniformly, so the calc engine doubles the sanering values rather
    than the extractors carrying duplicate fields. The annual vastrecht
    is ``max(0, yearly_fixed_fee − persons · korting) · fee_factor``.
    ``social_tariff=True`` applies the VMM 80 % reduction on the
    post-calc total.
