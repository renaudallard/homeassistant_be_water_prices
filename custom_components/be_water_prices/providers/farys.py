"""Farys (TMVW) -- biggest remaining Flemish operator (~1.5 M, ~22 % of Flanders).

Farys's `farys.be/nl/watertarieven` page is JS-rendered: the static
HTML carries only a 290-option commune dropdown and no rates. Selecting
a commune fires a Drupal AJAX form POST to
`/nl/watertarieven?ajax_form=1`; the response is a JSON envelope
containing an `insert` command whose `data` field is HTML markup with
the full per-commune integrale waterprijs structure (drinkwater +
gemeentelijke + bovengemeentelijke saneringsbijdragen, with the
standard VMM 50/30/20 + 10/6/4 vastrecht/korting split).

The extractor calls that endpoint directly with the commune ID baked
in (Gent-centrum = 25071 by default) and parses the rates out of the
`insert` command's HTML payload. The `form_build_id` field is
optional; the endpoint accepts a POST without it.

Per-commune data is real and varies (Gent-centrum's drinkwater is
3.0058 EUR/m³ in 2026, other communes differ). Gent-centrum is the
default since Gent is Farys's namesake city and the largest commune
in its Oost-Vl. heartland; users override via the OptionsFlow
commune dropdown.
