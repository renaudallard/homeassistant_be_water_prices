"""SWDE -- Société wallonne des eaux.

Largest Walloon distributor: ~2.4 M inhabitants across ~200 communes,
roughly two-thirds of Wallonia's population. Publishes its own CVD
(true-cost-of-supply) on https://www.swde.be/en/water-prices-swde
(the FR slug ``prix-de-l-eau-swde`` returns 404).

The page exposes the four bill components under their own ``<h3>``
headings, each followed by a ``<p>`` containing one ``<strong>`` with
the EUR value::

    <h3>1. True-cost of supply (CVD)</h3>
    <p>The current CVD amounts to <strong>€ 3.24/m³</strong>.</p>

    <h3>2. True cost of sanitation (CVA)</h3>
    <p>The current CVA is <strong>€ 2.748/m³</strong>.</p>

    <h3>3. VAT</h3>
    <p>For water supply, it amounts to <strong>6 %</strong>.</p>

    <h3>4. Social Water Fund</h3>
    <p>The current Social Water Fund amounts to <strong>€ 0.0339/m³</strong>.</p>

CVA and FSE are flat-Wallonia constants (set by SPGE / CWaPE) and live
in :mod:`const`; the parsed values are held to them and a move fails
the fetch, so the stale-snapshot Repair and the live check carry the
news rather than a log line.

The redevance (annual fixed fee) is the regulator-defined
``20·CVD + 30·CVA`` formula; we materialise it into
:attr:`WaterTariff.yearly_fixed_fee` here so the cost engine doesn't
re-derive it.

The page states no year. The card is dated by the clock, so a page
left on last year's rates in January is served as this year's and is
never stale by date. Nothing detects a CVD left on last year's value:
the CVA / FSE hold fails the fetch only when those two move, and the
daily live check only validates ranges.
