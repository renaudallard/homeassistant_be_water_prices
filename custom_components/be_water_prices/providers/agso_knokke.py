"""AGSO Knokke-Heist -- water utility for the single Knokke-Heist commune (~33 k pop).

Source: https://www.agsoknokke-heist.be/waterbedrijf/tarieven/tarieven-kleinverbruikers

The page exposes two tables side-by-side, one for the previous year
and one for the current year; the next-year section is introduced by a
``Wijziging per 1 januari <YYYY>`` heading. Each table follows the
canonical "Integrale waterprijs" layout::

    Tariefschijf       | Basis (huishoudelijk) | comfort | tot 1.000m³ | >1.000m³ | Vast recht | Korting/dom
    Drinkwater         | € 2,3295              | € 4,6590| € 2,7073    | € 2,1658 | € 50,00    | -€ 10,00
    Afvoer afvalwater  | € 1,9572              | € 3,9144| € 2,2173    | € 2,2173 | € 30,00    | -€ 6,00
    Zuivering afvalwater| € 1,7019             | € 3,4038| € 1,9281    | € 1,9281 | € 20,00    | -€ 4,00
    Integrale prijs ex-BTW | €5,9886           | ...

Picks the table the page labels with the year asked for, or the
newest year that has already started, as long as every table carries
a heading with a year. When one does not, or none of the dated tables
has started yet, the table whose "Integrale waterprijs" total is the
highest is taken as the current one, since operators only ever index
up year-on-year.

Stores all three components separately (drinkwater + afvoer +
zuivering) the way Pidpa does, so the ``basis_rate`` /
``sewerage_rate`` sensors decompose cleanly. Uses the standard
VMM vastrecht (50/30/20 + 10/6/4) materialised from
:mod:`const`.
