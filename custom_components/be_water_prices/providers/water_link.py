"""Water-link -- Antwerp city + ring (~200 k customers).

Source PDF (one per year), linked from the Antwerpen tariff page:
    https://water-link.be/sites/default/files/<YYYY>-<MM>/<YYYY>%20HH.pdf

The upload directory carries the month the card was published, so the link
is read off the tariff page rather than templated, and the January path is
kept only as a fallback. The page also links the "andere" and "NHH"
(non-household) cards, so the anchor has to reject those.

The watertarieven HTML page exposes 22 unlabelled rate tables and is
brittle to parse for "the current year"; the PDF link surfaced through
the same page (in the "Publicaties" sidebar) is much cleaner. It carries
one canonical set of rates for the year, broken down per commune::

    Tarieven Water-Link
    Geldig vanaf 1 januari 2026
                                          Water  Afvoer  Zuivering  Totaal
    Vastrecht per wooneenheid             50,0   30,0    20,0       100,0
    Korting per gedomicilieerde inwoner   -10,0  -6,0    -4,0       -20,0
    ...
    Integrale waterprijs basistarief
        Antwerpen                         1.6692 1.3345  1.7019     4.7056
        Beveren-Kruibeke-Zwijndrecht      1.6692 1.9572  1.7019     5.3283
        Edegem                            1.6692 1.9572  1.7019     5.3283
        ...

Drinkwater (Water column) and zuivering (Zuivering column) are uniform
across the service area; only the gemeentelijke afvoer differs by
commune (Antwerpen sits lower at 1.3345 €/m³, the four ring communes
at 1.9572 €/m³). The PDF carries one BASISTARIEF row per commune --
five in 2026: Antwerpen, Beveren-Kruibeke-Zwijndrecht, Edegem, Hove,
Mortsel. The extractor stores **Antwerpen's rates** as the default
since it is the city Water-link is named after and accounts for the
bulk of customers; ring-commune users pick their commune via the
OptionsFlow to get the right sanering rate.

Comforttarief is exactly 2× basis per VMM mandate; we cross-check.
