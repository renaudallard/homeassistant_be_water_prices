"""Per-utility extractor protocol and shared dataclasses.

Each utility module under ``providers/`` exposes a top-level
``EXTRACTOR: WaterExtractor`` whose ``fetch`` callable returns one
:class:`WaterTariff`. The coordinator combines that with the user's
configured consumption / household size to produce the projected annual
cost. No EUR values live in Python source -- everything in
:class:`WaterTariff` comes from a live fetch of the utility's own
publication.

All EUR figures stored in :class:`WaterTariff` are **ex-VAT**. Belgian
water is residentially taxed at 6 %; ``vat_rate`` carries the rate so
the cost engine can re-apply it once at the end. Utilities that publish
VAT-incl numbers (VIVAQUA does) divide by ``1 + vat_rate`` at parse
time.
