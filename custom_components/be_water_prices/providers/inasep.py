"""INASEP -- Intercommunale Namuroise de Services Publics.

Wallonia (Namur sud), 10 communes, ~38 600 abonnés (~80-100 k people).
Source: https://www.inasep.be/prix-de-leau-et-evolution

The page lists the three components under a ``Tarifs YYYY`` heading,
e.g.::

    Tarifs 2026
    Coût-Vérité Distribution (CVD) = 3,6734 €/m³ depuis le 27 avril 2026
    Coût-Vérité Assainissement (CVA) = 2,748 €/m³ depuis le 1er janvier 2026
    Fonds social de l'Eau = 0,0339 €/m³ depuis le 1er janvier 2026

CVA and FSE are the SPGE flat-Wallonia constants and are
cross-checked. The parser anchors the CVD on the literal phrase
``Coût-Vérité Distribution (CVD)`` so the unrelated euros amounts
elsewhere on the page (annual-impact figures, per-glass examples)
can't win.

INASEP revises its CVD mid-year: the 2026 card dates it from 27 April.
The tariff is stamped from that day rather than from 1 January, so the
sensor attribute and the price backfill do not claim the rate for
months it did not apply to. The previous rate is not published, so the
year-to-date cost still bills the whole year's volume at the current
one.

# The page renders ``Coût-Vérité Distribution (CVD) = 3,6734 €/m³``,
# but bs4's text extraction drops the accents on some passes and the
# superscript ``³`` becomes a plain ``3``. Tolerate accent-stripped
# spellings of "Coût" and "Vérité".
#
# The day the rate took effect follows the unit: "3,6734 €/m³ depuis le
# 27 avril 2026" (bs4 renders the unit as "€ €/m 3"). It is captured as
# part of the same match so only a date glued to the CVD counts; the
# CVA's own "depuis le 1er janvier" a few words later cannot answer for
# it.
#
# Every optional piece of whitespace is tied to its literal. A shape
# like `\s*X?\s+` lets the engine split one run of spaces two ways and
# try every split when the match fails, which is quadratic in the run:
# a page with a few thousand spaces after the date held the parser for
# seconds, and the body cap allows millions.
