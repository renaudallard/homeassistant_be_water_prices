"""Shared builder for the small Walloon intercommunales.

IEG, AIEM, AIEC, CIESAC and IDEN all follow the standard CWaPE
residential structure (same as SWDE / inBW / CILE / INASEP) but each
serves a tiny territory and publishes their CVD on a single web page
in plain prose like::

    CVD : Coût Vérité de Distribution : 2,3800€/m³
    Valeur actuelle du CVD : 2,87€ HTVA
    (CVD) : 2,460 €/m³

CVA and FSE are the SPGE flat-Wallonia constants and come from
:mod:`const`. The redevance is materialised at parse time from the
regulator-defined ``20·CVD + 30·CVA`` formula.

IEG and AIEM expose their CVD on the operator's own site; AIEC,
CIESAC and IDEN don't carry the number on their official pages so
they pull from Callmepower's public aggregator listing instead.
