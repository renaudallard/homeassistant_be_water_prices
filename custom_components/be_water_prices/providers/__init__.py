"""Water-utility extractor registry.

Each utility module exposes a top-level ``EXTRACTOR``. Adding a new
utility means appending its module name to ``_MODULE_NAMES`` below.

The registry is built lazily on first call so importing a sibling
sub-module (e.g. ``_postcodes``) from a stdlib-only refresh script
does not pull in aiohttp / BeautifulSoup / pdfplumber via every
extractor module at package init time.
