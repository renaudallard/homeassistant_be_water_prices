"""De Watergroep -- 167 communes / ~3.3 M customers (~49.5 % of Flanders).

Two ingestion paths share the same cookie-driven endpoint:

  - **Default fetch** (no commune configured) hits the cookie-driven
    ``/Tarief/UpdateDetailTariefJaar/<year>`` endpoint with the Halle
    GUID and labels the snapshot ``"Halle (DWG-served default)"``.
    That gives the full integrale waterprijs (drinkwater +
    gemeentelijke + bovengemeentelijke saneringsbijdragen) for one
    representative DWG-served commune. There is nothing under it: the
    news article ``over-de-watergroep/nieuws/tarieven-<year>`` used to
    be the fallback and carries the drinkwater leg alone, which bills
    355.32 EUR a year where the Halle card bills 782.73.

  - **Per-commune fetch** GETs the same endpoint with the user-picked
    ``dwg_l=<GUID>`` cookie and returns the integrale waterprijs for
    that commune, with the standard VMM 50/30/20 + 10/6/4
    vastrecht/korting structure.

Commune list discovery: scrape the dropdown on
``/nl-be/drinkwater/tarieven`` (700+ ``<option>`` entries with GUID
values).

Comforttarief is exactly ``2 ×`` the basistarief by VMM mandate; we
materialise it.
