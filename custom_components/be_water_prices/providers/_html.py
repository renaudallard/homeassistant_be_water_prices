"""HTML scraping helpers for water-utility tariff pages.

Most Belgian water utilities publish their numerical tariff card on a
plain HTML page, often in a ``<table>``. This module provides:

* :func:`fetch_html` -- async GET wrapper that mirrors :func:`_pdf.fetch_text`
  but returns the raw HTML body. (Re-exported from ``_pdf`` so a future
  caller does not need to import both modules.)
* :func:`extract_amounts` -- regex helper that pulls every ``€ 12,34``
  amount from a string in document order.
