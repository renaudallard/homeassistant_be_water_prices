    for. Enabling the social tariff, registering a resident, or resolving
    the commune the household actually lives in each lower the bill for
    the rest of the year, and clamping those to a floor measured under the
    old answer published 437.56 EUR where 87.51 was owed, until January.

    Only those inputs are here. The tariff's own rates are deliberately
    absent: a cheaper card is exactly the transient this floor is for, and
    a real mid-year price cut still waits for the year to turn, which is
    the behaviour the README documents and four tests pin.

    The release is here for the same reason the others are. A release that
    corrects a rate downwards is not a dip either, and keying the floor on
    the rates would defeat it, so the version stands in: an upgrade
    rebuilds the floor once, and a correction reaches the running bill the
    day it ships rather than in January. Rebuilding is safe because the m3
    mark comes down only where the recorder has corrected it, and that path
    drops the floor as it goes, so the recomputed cost can only come out
    lower when the rates really are.

    The card's own year is here for the same reason again, and the price
    backfill has kept it in its gate all along for exactly this: when a
    publisher runs late every extractor serves last year's card until
    31 March, so January to March accrues at a stand-in's rates. Those are
    not a transient fetch, and if the real card comes in cheaper a floor
    that cannot tell the two apart holds the household on the stand-in
    until the year turns. A card year moves once, when the publisher
    catches up. A card put up ahead of its year does not move it: the year
    is the card in force's, so next year's card arriving in December leaves
    the closing year's floor where it is.

    Two shapes reach here that :func:`_change_exceeds_the_register` cannot
    see, because it compares a day against its own register rather than
    against a day. A counter re-based onto the real meter reading leaves a
    bucket whose change is the whole re-base but whose register is larger

    A day is dropped rather than held: there is no next reading to confirm
    it against, and the year's figure is a high-water mark, so admitting
    one bad day pins the bill until January.

    ``gap_days`` is how many days with no bucket of their own sit behind

    carries a meter's running total across a gap and attributes the whole

    from an outage holds the outage. Read as one day it looked like a
    re-based register and was dropped, and losing it cost the whole absence
    rather than the one day this used to say. The gap buys room at the rate
    a household plausibly draws, which is generous enough to keep a real

    figure indistinguishable from a frugal year, and offering that as the
    yearly consumption would understate the projection for as long as the
    user kept it. So the window opens in the previous December: a bucket
    before 1 January proves the meter was already running when the year
    started, and a bucket in the year's own December proves it was still
    running when the year ended.

    Asking for history on either side rather than for a bucket dated

    day has no bucket at all, and a household away over New Year would fail
    the stricter test while having a perfectly complete year. The days in

    January to November and came back in December had history on both

    in three is the bar, which a household away for the summer clears and
